# Natural Language Processing (NLP)

Hello,  welcome to the NLP assignments.

There are three assignments regarding the natural language process.


### Noisy Channel and a Probabilistic Spell Checker
A spell checker that handles both non-word and real-word errors given in a sentential context.
- Builds a language model from a corpus.
- Uses noisy channel model and probabilistic evaluations.
- Checks whether the sentence has a spelling error and corrects it.

### Text classification and Authorship Attribution
A classifier that uses various algorithms for text classification, performing an authorship attribution task on tweets.
- Train/test splitting.
- Features extraction.
- 4 classification algorithms (Logistic regression, SVM, Naive Bayes, FFNN).
- Accuracy measurement (K-fold cross validation).


### Part of Speech (POS) Tagging
A tagger that uses a Hidden Markov generative sequence model (HMM) to tag parts of speech of a given sentence.
